          Name: Jonna Paiss<br />

Role: Consumer Sales and Education Representative<br />

Years with Nordic Naturals: 5
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What do you do at Nordic Naturals, and what do you like best about your job?</b> I

work in customer service, so I answer questions about our products all day long. I’ve

always been interested in nutrition and biology, and I like helping people find the right

supplement for them. I used to work in the healthcare industry, and for me working in the

natural products industry is much more satisfying.
</p>
<p>
One reason I like talking about our products is because I have so much confidence in

them. I try everything we make so I can get a firsthand experience with each product. I

keep a spice rack in my bathroom filled with all my Nordic Naturals supplements, and I

tend to mix and match.
</p>
<p>
<b>What’s the strangest customer question you’ve ever received?</b> I certainly get some

very specific questions from customers, everything from whether or not our products are

kosher to what kinds of glue we use on our product labels. It’s part of the fun, you know,

going and hunting down the answers to the more unusual questions.
</p>
<p>
I guess the strangest question I ever got was from a woman who called to ask about the

tiny illustrated trolls on our Nordic Berries multivitamin label. She wanted to know if

they were associated with the occult. I told her the trolls were common in Norwegian

fairy tales, nothing more than a fanciful reference to Scandinavian folklore.

</p>
<p>
<b>Where did you grow up?</b> I was born and raised in a small town in Denmark, and I

immigrated to the US when I was in my twenties. I practically grew up in a library... I

spent most of my teenage years with my head in a book, and I’m still a voracious reader

today.
</p>
<p>

<b>Since you’ve been here for 5 years, I gather you’ve been taking fish oil for a while.

Any observations you’d like to share?</b> Probably the biggest thing I noticed when I first

started working here was the high product quality. I’ve always trusted the science behind

the nutrition, so I never questioned things I experienced in the past with other products,

like fishy aftertaste or unpleasant burps. I just figured those things were to be tolerated,

the way you tolerate other things that might be good for you—like onions.
</p>
<p>
<b>What Nordic Naturals products do you take?</b> I currently take Omega Curcumin, EPA

with concentrated GLA, vitamin D3, and Nordic Flora Probiotic Daily. Over the years

I’ve tried a lot of different formulations, but in general I try to take 2000 mg EPA+DHA

daily. In the winter especially, I take vitamin D3 regularly. And I supplement with other

products, like Omega Curcumin and Omega Vision, depending on whatever issue I may

be trying to address. When I first tried our Nordic Flora probiotics, I was like, oh my god!

I guess I was bloated! Because I felt an immediate difference. (laughs)
</p>
<p>
<b>What is something about you that few people know? Do you have a hidden talent?</b> I

have nothing BUT hidden talents. All my talents are really hard to find! One advantage of

talking to new people all day is that my jokes never get old. I try to be light about things,

because I enjoy making people laugh.
</p>
<p>
I happen to know that you’re really good at crafting. Yes, I do like to sew and knit

and do crafty things. I’m really into making costumes right now. And a lot of people

don’t know this, but I’m actually a good cook. I developed some pretty good cooking

skills in college—whisking and stirring, those are my hidden talents. And talking and

enjoying good food with friends.
</p>
<p>
<b>We talk a lot about health here at Nordic Naturals. What does living “healthfully”

mean to you?</b> To me “living healthfully” is a state of mind. It’s about striving for

harmony and balance in your life. We have a saying in Denmark: “Everything in

moderation, including moderation.” I think it’s important to pick your battles in life, and

focus on what gives you enjoyment. Otherwise it’s really easy to get frustrated and feel

powerless. I guess you could say I try not to sweat the small stuff.
<p>
  <p>
Video Question: You’re from Denmark. Explain “hygge” to us.
